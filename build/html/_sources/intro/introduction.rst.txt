DBNS is a network security system composed of latest opensource big data components. Within the architecture building and efficiency optimization, the DBNS system can afford various methods to analysis 1GBPS network flow within a single node server, and up to 10GBPS network flow within a three-node server cluster. In the github, we show the source code of the single-node mode and wish you to provide your advice for our project.

DBNS system is developed by **Network Computing Center** of **Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University**. You can contact luoshengjie@sjtu.edu.cn for more information.
